## Azure
> This Repository is for random Microsoft Azure scripts I have created for one task or another.

> I get inspiration and help from the PowerShell and Microsoft Azure community so willing to give back in return, also happy if you fork any of the files - or recommend improvements.

## Usage example

Unless specified otherwise, every script can usually be ran directly from Powershell or the PowerShell ISE as Administrator. 
These scripts are Azure based so need the AzureRM cmdlets installed.
